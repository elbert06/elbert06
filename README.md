### Hi there, I'm Dohun Kim! 👋

I am an undergraduate student in **Electrical Engineering** at **Inha University**, South Korea.  
Formerly a software enthusiast from **Korea Digital Media High School (Dimigo)**, I am now pivoting my strong software engineering background toward **Semiconductor Process Optimization (OPC)** and **Computational Lithography**.

Currently serving in the ROK Military 🇰🇷 (2026.02 ~ 2027.08)  
*Preparing for the next leap in Lithography: From Data-driven to Physics-driven.*

### 🔭 Next Challenge: Overcoming Diffraction Limits
**Research Interest: Physics-Informed OPC & Inverse Lithography**
> *"How can we restore patterns lost by light diffraction?"*
- Moving beyond data-driven GANs, my next goal is to tackle the **diffraction limit** in High-NA EUV processes.
- Studying **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** to integrate optical diffraction equations into AI models.
- Aiming to develop a **Next-Gen OPC Solver** that combines Deep Learning with Rigorous Simulation.

### 🏆 Registered Work
**[Copyright] M-Bridge GAN System for Lithography Optimization** (Reg. No. C-2025-060029)
> *My first step into Computational Lithography.*
- Developed a lightweight GAN model with a 'Mediator' to stabilize training for EUV defect detection.
- **Achievement:** Successfully stabilized Loss (0.4~0.6) and optimized for edge computing.
